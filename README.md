# A 400 line simple battleship game built in python using John Zelle's graphics engine.
This game features a dynamically adapting enemy that will attempt to kill your ships. It is my first computer science project ever.

TO PLAY:
Run the python script in a terminal window. Enter your name, then a date, and the graphics window will pop up with instructions.
